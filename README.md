# meet app

## Project description

This is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

### Features

#### Feature 1: Filter events by city

##### Scenario 1: When user hasn't searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities

- Given user hasn't searched for any city
- When the user opens the app
- Then the user should see a list of upcoming events from all locations

##### Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they searched for a city

- Given the main page is open
- When user starts typing in the city textbox
- Then the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they've typed

##### Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list

- Given the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox
- And the list of suggested cities is showing
- When the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list
- Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”)
- And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city

#### Feature 2: Show/hide an event's details

##### Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default

- Given the user has started the app
- When the user doesn't click on an event
- Then the event details will be collapsed

##### Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details

- Given the user has started the app
- When the user clicks on an event
- Then the event details will expand

##### Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details

- Given the user has expanded the details of an event
- When the user clicks on the event details
- Then the event details will collapse

#### Feature 3: Specify number of Events

##### Scenario 1: When user hasn't specified a number, 32 is the default number

- Given the user is on the main page
- When the user has not specified the numbers of events
- Then the default number of displayed events will be 32

##### Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see

- Given the user is on the main page
- When the user changes the number of events
- Then the number of events will change accordingly

#### Feature 4: Use the app when offline

##### Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection

- Given the user has no internet connection
- When the user starts the app
- Then the app will operate with cached data

##### Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)

- Given the user has no internet connection
- When the user tries to change the settings
- Then the app will display an error

#### Feature 5: Data visualization

##### Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city

- Given the user has started the app
- When the user has not searched for a city
- Then a chart with the number of upcoming events will be displayed

#### Feature 6: Select dark or light mode

##### Scenario 1: Display the app in dark mode by default

- Given that the user has not enabled browser settings for light mode
- When the user has started the app
- Then the app should be displayed in dark mode by default

##### Scenario 2: User can change dark and light modes

- Given the user has started the app
- When the user clicks on the dark and light mode switch
- Then the styling of the app will change the dark or light mode
